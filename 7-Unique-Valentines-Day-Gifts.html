          A</span>re you searching for the perfect Valentine’s
        gift for those on your list, who are the most difficult to buy for, or possibly doing your
        shopping last minute and need a quick idea? Well look no further! We here at <span style="color:black;">Seven Step Studio's&copy;</span> have compiled a complete
        list -sure to satisfy even the most, “particular” gift- recipient.
        In this list, we have created multiple categories of gifts which each have their subcategories,
        ranging from affordable gifts to expensive gifts, and everything in between.
        We guarantee you’ll find something for everyone on your list; so continue to read on
        for some unique Valentine’s Day gift ideas
        <p>1. Gift Cards
	Gift Cars are an easy go-to idea for anyone on your list, especially if you’re short on time or have no clue what to get for your extremely picky girlfriend (who claims she doesn’t want anything “special” —but we all know that’s a lie). Anyway, if you want to buy a gift card but need a little help finding the best one we have listed some of our favorites including Department stores, restaurants, grocery stores, or any other place you might think your receiver will enjoy!
	 Let’s first start with, our personal favorite, Department Stores (i.e. Target, Walmart, Kmart, and more!). These stores will allow whomever your buying for the ability to go on their own shopping-spree. Stores like these offer a wide variety of items such as electronics, games, clothing, home goods, and much more. A gift card to a department store is sure to make anyone on your list excited.
	 Along with department stores, another option would be to give a gift card that focuses on food or grocery shopping. We believe these are one of the best ideas for anyone who wants to give something they know their loved-one will use; and who doesn’t need food? Along with the gift of food we also think this is a thoughtful idea for couples who are just moving in together, (because we all know half the fun of living with your partner is the grocery shopping together…)
	Finally, if you feel as though you would rather give your special-someone on your list a unique experience, you could give them a gift card to their favorite restaurant. However, If you already have a store in mind you can always get them one of those as well. Along with gift cards being an extremely easy and versatile gift idea, they are also very accessible and you can choose any price range you would like. As previously mentioned these cards are something you can get almost anywhere; from the store itself, online, to sometimes at your local grocery store. Finally, these are great if you’re trying to find something for an exact budget or even something inexpensive. Gift cards can range from a few dollars to upwards of hundreds of dollars. We suggest getting multiple gift cards for different options if you're looking to spend over one-hundred dollars (unless you are giving someone a gift card to help with a big purchase, such as a computer, where it would make more sense to cover the majority of the cost.) </p>

<p>2. Accessories
If you are looking for a creative Valentine’s Day idea that is sure to bring a smile to your loved one’s face, consider gifting them their favorite type of accessories. Just like gift cards are easy to find while being a simple idea, so are accessories. For accessories, however, you have multiple options from things that will help get through the arctic chill of the winter to everyday items you can use whatever temperature it is. 
	Since the winter season is just hitting its peak (before calming down in no less than two months) our  recommendations is winter accessories. This a cozy option if you want to buy someone a meaningful gift they are sure to use. These winter ideas also come in a wide-varieties of price ranges; so whether you need to spend five more dollars or five-hundred we have ideas for you. The first, and cheapest, is a pair of gloves or a hat; these are great additions to gifts if you want to add a little spice; because you can get them typically for less than five dollars. Another classic idea is a jacket; you can get these in a variety of heat-levels so your loved one can survive a mild winter in Florida or an apocalyptic snowstorm. As well as the previously stated these can fit all budgets because coats can start at fifteen dollars.
	 Although season-specific gifts are wonderful for a short time, you may be looking for another all-year-round gift like a few of our other options. For these accessories, we usually recommend getting something based on your price range. For example, if you’re looking for something on the less expensive side you may want to shop for: purses, ties or other articles of clothing, backpacks, and shoes/slippers. However, if you have a higher budget you might be interested in giving someone a: luxury purse or wallet, jewelry, phone cases, sunglasses, and many more items. 
 	Accessories can be a budget-friendly or more luxurious which can make them appealing when trying to find something in a specific price range. Whether you're spending more money or not these gifts can be conveniently ordered online or in person at most stores; thoughtful accessories will make the person on your list feel special and appreciated.
</p>
<p>3. An Experience
 There are many things to do on Valentine’s Day that’s why gifting an experience is such a thoughtful idea. We love these kinds of gifts here on ‘Seven Step Studio’! They are one-of-a-kind but also can be incredibly simple. If you’re looking for an idea to surprise someone and give them memories of a lifetime we recommend gifting someone an experience. This is a marvelous idea if you want to spend time with the person. Just like our previous suggestions, these vary in price. 
 	If you are interested in spending less money then there are multiple ways, including buying tickets to an event in advance (a few months prior), finding a cheaper attraction (such as museums), or looking for deals on the tickets. Some of the cheaper experiences you can gift are movie tickets for that film they have been dying to see (around $25 for two), arcade gift cards (send them there with around $30 this will easily give them options for games and a light dinner), or even a museum (you can find deals on Groupon or buy for a discounted date).
 	Next, if you have a larger budget for those on your list this year you could give them a more unique kind of experience, while still researching to find the best deal. Some of our favorite experiences from this category include wine tasting (around $60 for two), a massage (which are typically priced around $100 for a single message), taking someone out to dinner (depending where you go a dinner for two can start at $30 plus tip), theme park passes (season passes start at around $150 for two), or even a night stay at a hotel (usually starting around $120). 
	Like most of our items previously listed, experiences can be a magnificent way to show someone you enjoy their company and want tot spend more time with. Along with this it is also a fabulous way to save money because you’re telling the person the whole date is their gift.
</p>
<p>4. A Subscription

As we all know Valentine’s can be a time where you might just want to cuddle up and watch one of your favorite movies, or perhaps (and only in the most perfect relationships) binge watching a series together. While subscriptions are typically a little more expensive than an average gift, you are giving someone an infinite amount of experiences over the year. These ideas are splendid if you are looking to give someone a present they can use all year-round while enjoying their favorite things. Some of our favorite subscriptions are to any streaming, grocery, shaving, or lifestyle services.
	 One of the best ideas is to give a streaming service because there are so many and nearly everyone is using them currently. As many individuals know Disney Plus has just been launched and everyone is wanting it! Be entertained by countless hours of your choice of television shows or movies. Some of our other favorite platforms include Hulu, Netflix, Disney Plus, and many more.
	Next, we suggest giving a grocery or beauty subscription to those on your list. Anyone will love this ideas!  There are multiple beauty subscriptions including: shaving supplies, monthly makeup boxes, and clothing subscriptions. Gifting a grocery or beauty subscription will cut down on the hassle of your loved-one going out and getting these products by themselves, and every time the subscription arrives they will be thinking of you!
	Subscriptions can be an easy way to take care of everyone on your list while giving the ‘trendiest’ gifts. Although, subscriptions can be quite a bit more expensive than most of the options on where they are one of the most unique and ensure you’ll leave a lasting impression as you’re giving a gift for at the whole year.
</p>
<p>5. Games
	Another idea that the person you’re shopping for will love is a game. This present is so versatile because you can get a game that just about anyone on your list will enjoy. For example, you could buy your friend the new Xbox game they want and be left wondering, how that gift could be so easy to think of while the gift for grandma (if you buy Valentine’s for your grandma.) is immensely more difficult to think of. Well, stop scratching your head because we have a solution; we know grandma doesn’t know what an “Xbox is” of how to even insert the disk. So instead of making grandmas life a complete nightmare, we decided a game that all ages can enjoy is a puzzle. Puzzles are thoughtful for almost anyone and is a useful way to engage your problem-solving skills while still feeling fulfilled once you have completed it.
	Another idea for those on your list who don’t want to spend three hours trying to cram the wrong piece into a slightly different shape, buy them a strategy game. These games help keep your mind active while learning how to implement strategies to quite literally take over the world. If the person you're buying for is a fan of these types of games recommend buying them one like Catan or Risk. Not only are these games hours of fun they are also relatively inexpensive and a fun way to spend time together. A strategy game can start from $20 to around $50.
	Games can be an affordable option for gifts and also allow you to give a creative gift that everyone will have fun with, even the pickiest people on your list. Games are also a unique way for you and your Valentine to get to know each other better.
</p>
<p>6. Health and Beauty
	Let’s face it we could all use a little more self-care in our life, so could the people on your list. It has always been one of our personal favorites to grab a few soaps, lotions, and perfumes/colognes for individuals on our list. Not only are you giving them something they can use (unless you give them one of those decorative soaps that no one uses), you’re also providing them with a necessity. Health and Beauty to us also mean giving experiences that allow our loved ones to ‘treat themselves.’
	Let’s talk about budget, if your budget is under twenty dollars we recommend the following: a gift card to get manicure or pedicure, face masks (that you can find at your local beauty supply store or Lush), soaps and bath bombs, or any mini-sized makeup pallet or makeup. Along with these if you find a deal you could also find a great perfume or cologne.
	Next, if your budget is under fifty dollars, you might want to consider buying the person on your list a gift card to a hair salon,  to get a massage, or even a facial. Along with these if you have a luxury beauty product your significant other is dying to try you could get them that.
Finally, if your budget is over one-hundred dollars you can give a more expensive massage or in some cases a couples massage, a better hair salon card, beauty supplies like the new lotion they have been raving about, or even multiple beauty items.
	Health and beauty items are a marvelous gift idea if you’re looking to make someone in your life feel special. These gifts come in a range of prices and will fit anyone's budget.
</p>
<p>7. Comfort Items
 If you aren’t looking to make your Valentine a card you could consider another item they might think is equally personal and that is a comfort item. If you’re like us then you love to give gifts that people can put to practical use, and you know they will use it; that’s what this category is for! These are also an affordable way to save money during this expensive season, as you can make them or purchase them at a low cost. Whether you’re shopping for someone older, younger or anyone in between there is an item this category for you.
	One place to start is in our favorite subcategory: blankets and pillows. These items can be easily purchased at most stores or if you choose to make your own, the supplies can be bought at your local craft store. An advantage to making your pillows and blankets is, you can buy a bulk supply, for around the same amount you would for the items, and have triple the presents for the same cost. Along with being a cheaper alternative to buying a pre-made present, it also appears more thoughtful.
	Next, if you’re shopping for a child or someone who is a collector of toys, you might want to select something they would enjoy, such as stuffed animals, plush toys, and more. In addition to these comfort items if you’re shopping for a child you could also give them mittens, or hats. these items can be bought in the store or with a little help from youtube, homemade. If you want to leave a lasting impression and don’t know what plush you the person on your list would like, then we recommend making them a custom stuffed animal or doll because its less-specific and will hold a higher value than if you give them a specific type of doll that they might not even enjoy.
	Finally, if you have a bit more of a budget and are shopping for someone old we suggest buying them furniture, an example would be: chair, duvets, backpacks, …ect. These items are great because they can range in price from $20 to $200. A chair or similar furniture (i.e. beanbag chair) could also be a great idea for children so they can not only use their chair later on but also while they open the rest of their gifts.
	Comfort items can be a great way to show you care about someone and their relaxation. These items are also unique gifts because you can custom make them with little effort while being affordable. If you buy the right supplies you can also make multiple gift for (sometimes) under twenty dollars. Finally, you can find a maid of times in your price range whether its pillows, blankets, plush toys or even furniture, you’re sure to give the more creative present when you give a comfort item.
